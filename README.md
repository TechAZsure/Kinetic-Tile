Problem Statement: 
      While the hybrid tile addresses the need for versatile, sustainable energy solutions, challenges include managing initial costs and optimizing efficiency. Balancing these factors is crucial for widespread adoption, positioning our hybrid energy-generating tile as a comprehensive solution in the clean energy market.
      
Prototype Description: 
      Our hybrid energy-generating tile is a 12x12cm cube integrating both kinetic and solar energy harvesting. Comprising neodymium magnets, coils, and a solar panel, the tile maximizes power generation. When compressed by foot traffic, the magnets induce current in coils, while the solar panel captures sunlight. An IoT-enabled monitoring system tracks real-time power generation, providing insights through a mobile app and web-based dashboard.
      
Working:
    Foot traffic causes magnets to move relative to coils, generating electricity. Simultaneously, the solar panel captures sunlight to produce additional power. The IoT system monitors both energy sources, offering users comprehensive data on production and utilization.
    
Advantages:
    Dual Energy Sources: Harnesses kinetic and solar energy for increased efficiency.
    Real-time Monitoring: IoT system provides insights for optimized energy use.
    
Sustainability:
  Utilizes renewable sources, contributing to eco-friendly solutions.
  
Limitations:
  Initial Cost:
    Integrating solar panels may increase installation expenses.
  Efficiency Variability:
    Dependence on both kinetic and solar sources may result in variable power output.
  Space Requirements: 
    Solar panels may require additional space, limiting applicability in certain settings.
